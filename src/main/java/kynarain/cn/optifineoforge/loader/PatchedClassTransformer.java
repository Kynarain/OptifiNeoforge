/**
 * Puts OptiFine's own compilation of a game class in place of NeoForge's.
 *
 * <p>This exists because of a dead end worth writing down. On these lines OptiFine's patches are
 * deltas against the <em>obfuscated</em> game jar, and its runtime transformer applies them by asking
 * for the obfuscated base class as a resource - which NeoForge's runtime, being officially named,
 * cannot provide. Every single target fails:</p>
 *
 * <pre>java.io.IOException: Base resource not found: fcn.class
 *   at optifine.Patcher.applyPatch(Patcher.java:148)
 *   at optifine.OptiFineTransformer.getOptiFineResourcePatched(OptiFineTransformer.java:441)</pre>
 *
 * <p>So the patching is done offline instead, where the obfuscated jar still exists, and the finished
 * classes travel in this jar. They cannot simply be flattened into it at their real paths - that makes
 * this jar's module export packages the {@code minecraft} module already exports, and the module layer
 * refuses to resolve it:</p>
 *
 * <pre>java.lang.module.ResolutionException: Modules srg and minecraft export package
 *   net.minecraft.client.renderer.block to module mixinsynthetic</pre>
 *
 * <p>Hence the storage path: the finished classes live under {@code optifineoforge/patched/}, whose
 * entries claim no game package, and this transformer puts their content into the class the game asked
 * for. {@code optifineoforge/patched-index.txt} lists which ones there are, because a ModLauncher
 * transformer has to declare its targets before it is ever called.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only the members and the type hierarchy are taken from OptiFine's version; the class's own name
 * and version stay as the game asked for them. What NeoForge added to the class and OptiFine's
 * compilation lacks is put back by {@link MemberRestoreTransformer}, which is why this transformer has
 * to run first.</p>

		// while the game layer reads this one without any help (the same log line says

		// So the payload's superclass is rewritten onto the runtime's instead, and {@link #reparent}

		// measured cases differ. 1.20.4's BlockEntity can be moved and is; 1.20.2's cannot, because its
		// runtime superclass declares serializeCaps() final while OptiFine's class overrides it -
		//
		//   IncompatibleClassChangeError: class BlockEntity overrides final method
		//     net.neoforged.neoforge.common.capabilities.CapabilityProvider.serializeCaps()
		//
		// - and 1.20.2 is verified to start with that class swapped in as it is, Forge superclass and all.

		// patches a game class to implement its extension interface and its own code then casts to it,

		//   runtime BlockEntity implements net.neoforged.neoforge.common.extensions.IBlockEntityExtension
