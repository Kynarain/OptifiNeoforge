/**
 * Rewrites an OptiFine payload's SRG member names to the official ones NeoForge's runtime uses.
 *
 * <p>This is a build step, not a loader transformer, and that is the point: this project already
 * repacks OptiFine's jar and patches the game jar offline, so every class that needs new member names
 * is in hand before the game starts. Doing it here also sidesteps ModLauncher, whose transformers have
 * to declare their targets up front - and the classes to rewrite are thousands.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link ClassRemapper} is used rather than editing references by hand because a payload's SRG
 * names appear in <em>declarations</em> as well as in references: OptiFine's replacement of a game
 * class declares its own members, and it declares them with SRG names, so a class that only had its
 * call sites rewritten would satisfy nobody. The remapper maps both through the same method, which is
 * what keeps a declaration and the calls to it consistent.</p>
 *
 * <p>Class names are left alone: since 1.17 the payload already uses official class names and only
 * the members are SRG. Descriptors are left alone for the same reason.</p>
 *
 * <p>On a line where OptiFine already speaks official names (1.20.6 and later) this finds no SRG
 * names and copies the jar through unchanged, so it is safe to leave in every line's pipeline.</p>
